segmetation model is taken from:https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilpandey360/lung-segmentation-from-chest-x-ray-dataset

covid data is taken from:https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

additional pneumonia data for pretraining is taken from:https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The aim is not only to make a model which can classify the chest x-ray data but also to extract the heat maps  of the x-ray for faster diagnosis and making it more reliable to use in real time.
Plans include:
1. using a lung segmenatation model to get rid of unnecessary biases and create new data.
2. using self super learning to pretrain a CNN model with new data taken from various sources.
3. fine tuining it on the classification task and getting Grad-cam heatmaps.
4.creating a fully optimised pipeline for the above in one package

Reason to choose X-ray scans and not CT scans is due to the fact that x-ray is cheaper and safer than CT scans and almost all hospitals have them.
Results look like:
Normal Lungs(cropped input)

The above results were obtained by using an esnsemble of two classification models and their combined Grad-CAM heatmaps.
The inputs are cropped to focus on the lungs using the lungs segmentation model specified above.
The first model is pretraied on Non croppped pneumonia dataset and fine tuned on the center cropped covid data set.
The oher model is pretraied on croppped pneumonia dataset and fine tuned on the cropped covid data set using segmentataion model.
