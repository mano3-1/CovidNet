The aim is not only to make a model which can classify the chest x-ray data but also to extract the heat maps  of the x-ray for faster diagnosis and making it more reliable to use in real time.
Using lung segmentation models and self supervised pretraining on vairous datasets and pretraining tasks to make a more general model and using gradcam to get unbiased activation heatmaps.
